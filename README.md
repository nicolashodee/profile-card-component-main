# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component solution

This is a solution to the [Profile card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ). 

## Overview

- The goal was to build out the project to the designs provided in the image below. It has been a long time since I didn't touch CSS, and it took me half a day to (almost) do it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned


```html
to be completed once the project is finished
```
```css
to be completed once the project is finished
```

### Continued development

I am still struggling with the background at the moment, as I didn't manage to figure out how to hide parts of the 2 images so that there is no more scroll possible. 
The 2 rounds appears in totality while they should be "cropped", appearing behind the card. Any help would be much appreciated! 

### Useful resources

- [CSS shadows](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me to get interesting CSS shadows for the card.
- [CSS positioning](https://css-tricks.com/absolute-positioning-inside-relative-positioning/) - This is an amazing article which helped me to understand better positioning for inline elements.
